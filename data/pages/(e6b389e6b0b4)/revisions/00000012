泉水 {{attachment:Fountain.png}} ，主要是由<<Color2("{",blue,gray)>>（左大括号）表示的地牢地形，但可能由<<Color2("¶",blue,gray)>>（pilcrow），<<Color2("⌠",blue,gray)>>（pilcrow）（上半整数）或<<Color2("Ї",blue,gray)>>（西里尔大写字母YI）表示，这取决于您的操作系统和选项​​（参见下面关于符号的说明）。

它们随机分散在整个地牢，一般在房间，没有任何其他的地牢地形功能（即：箱子，水槽）。

您可以通过它来浸渍物品，并畅饮它的水，可以向下挖掘。

在非特殊层的喷泉有1/7（14％）的几率是魔法的，不能在使用前确定属性。挖水槽将创建一个非魔法喷泉。
